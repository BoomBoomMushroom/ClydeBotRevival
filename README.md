# This is my recreation of Clyde Bot!
/lobotomy | resets the message history in the server it was run in
/setprompt PROMPT | sets the system instructions for clyde in that server
/getprompt | responds with the server's clyde system instructions

Ping Clyde in any part of the message to get him to respond!
If you reply to a message he can see what message you're replying to.
He can see images in a message sent to him but not in replies

The settings.json is purely for Clyde, and he will modify them himself.
the config.json is for the bot owner to edit!
